======================

**pykep** has been created by the pagmo development Team at the European Space Agency and was once part of the project
`pagmo/pygmo <https://github.com/esa/pagmo2>`_. As of the release 2.0 of pagmo the decision was taken to move the
entire keplerian_toolbox and its python alter-ego (pykep) to a different project and to keep supporting complete
compatibility between the two projects.

**pykep** is in use at the European Space Agency's Advanced Concepts Team since 2006.

**Main Developer**:
